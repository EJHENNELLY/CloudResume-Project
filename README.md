# CloudResume-Project
Deploying my resume with AWS

I have been working to transition into a tech career for some time now and like most people, I spent tons of time, money, and effort stressing over certifications that I was led to believe would be the key to me landing a role in the dynamic tech industry. After having achieved the certifications that I thought would change everything, I started applying to jobs and began realizing that while these certs showed I was a quick-learner and were "proof" that I had the necessary knowledge to do the job, I still did not have much to offer in terms of anything that I had built. My cybersecurity and security engineer certifications mostly just allowed me to show screen shots of walk throughs that I had done during the course of my learning. So, I decided to create something to show to hiring managers. But what? I hate to admit that it took me sometime to determine what to create. In the end, it seemed fairly obvious.... A resume.

In this project, I am going to walk through the steps I took to create this resume and the things I learned along the way.
